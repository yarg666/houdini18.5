== Overview ==
#id: LYNX_fabric_thread_profile_overview

Features:
* Setup the profile of your thread curves.
* Feed in custom points via the first input or connect a custom boundary object, which is on the XY plane, into the second input on which to scatter the points. 

@inputs

Input 0:
    Feed in custom points here.
    
Input 1:
    Feed in a custom boundary object, which is on the XY plane, on which to scatter the points on. If there is no input, a circle is used.

@outputs

Output:
   The curve profile with corresponding point widths.


@parameters

== General ==
#id: LYNX_fabric_thread_profile_general

Width Post Scale:
    Scale the `width` of the points after packing them into the bounding geometry.

== Scatter Points ==
The points are scattered and packed into the bounding geometry.

Scatter Seed:
    The seed value of the scattering.
Scatter Count:
    The amount of points to scatter.
Width:
    The point widths are generated via a random value between 0-1 based on the point number and seed value. They are then remapped via the ramp. The `Width Minimum` parameter clamps the resulting values. This prevents widths that are very small, which could cause the node to crash when calculating the scatter distribution.
