"""Get control of your velocities via an intuitive UI or groom them for absolute fine tuned control."""
:vimeo: Tutorial
    #id: 298850328


== Overview ==
#id: velocity_overview

Features:
* Set and randomize velocities via custom edge selections.
* Groom the velocities for absolute control.
    

@outputs

Output:
    Geometry with the modified velocity attribute specified by the [Velocity Attribute Name|#velocity_attribute_velocity].


@parameters

== General ==
#id: velocity_general

Velocity Attribute Name:
    #id: velocity_attribute_velocity
    The name of the attribute to modify. You can put any vector attribute here. If the attribute doesn't exist, it will be created.

== Velocity Via Edges ==
"""Here you can control the velocities via edge selections."""
    
Enable Velocity Via Edges: 
    Enable/Disable all effects in this tab.
Collapse All Settings: 
    Collapse all edge selection sets below to have a cleaner UI. 
    
Edge Selection Sets | Set Settings:
    * Skip: Skip this selection set.
    * Solo: Display only this selection (or all that have `Solo` toggled on).
    * Use Boundry Edges: Instead of selecting an edge selection manually you can enable this to use open boundries in your geometry as the selection.
    * Edge Group: If `Use Boundry Edges` is disabled, this allows you to pick edges on your geometry for modifiying the velocity attribute.

Edge Selection Sets | Control Settings:
    * General: 
        * Transfer Mode: Here you define how you velocities are transferred. You can choose between adding them or multipling them with existing velocities. When using `Multiply` make sure that you already have incoming velocities or else it will just return a vector of zero.
        * Reverse UV: This let's you reverse the uv range for the ramp below, meaning that the ramps are applied in reverse.
        * Smooth Pre: This smooths out the velocities before applying them to the geometry. This can be useful to smooth out noise.
        * Smooth Post: This controls how feathered/smoothed the velocities are applied to the rest of the geometry that is not in the edge selection.
    * Rotation/Strength:
        The `Rotation`/`Strength` tabs generally work the same way. The angle and strength are remapped by the `Rotate`/`Strength` ramps. The input uv for these ramps is modified by the `Offset`/`Repeat`/`Reverse UV` values and the output is scaled to the `Min/Max` values. The `Angle`/`Strength` parameters offset the rotation of the velocity/scale the velocity respectively. The noise `Offset`/`Scale`/`Min`/`Max` values do the same thing, the only difference being that they add a noise offset to you vectors.
        * Angle/Strength: Here you can offset the angle / multiply the strength of you velocity.
        * Offset/Repeat/Min/Max: Controll the offset/repeat/min/max values as described above.
        * Noise Offset/Scale/Min/Max: Same as the parameter above only for adding noise to break up the velocities.
        * Rotate/Strength Remap: Remaps the angle along the uv range modified by the parameters above.
        * Rotate/Strength Remap Start To End: Remaps the angle along the original unmodified uv range.
        
== Velocity Groom ==
"""Here you can groom your velocities via the houdini groom brushes."""

Enable Velocity Grooming: 
    Enable/Disable all effects in this tab.
Reset Strokes: 
    With this button you can reset the groom.
Recache Strokes:
    With this button you can reapply the groom if the geometry or incoming velocities have changed.
Groom Tool Controls:
    See the [guidegroom|Node:sop/guidegroom] node for more information.

:warning: When the input geometry or the incoming velocities change you have to press `Recache Strokes` or `Reset Strokes` in order for the new velocities to be updated.
